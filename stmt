Interviews is a live and interactive coding environment inside HackerRank for hiring companies to conduct technical interviews. Typically, in a companyâ€™s hiring process, candidates who clear their initial level of assessments are subsequently invited to participate in a coding interview on HackerRank's Interview platform which is fully remote. It is also a great platform for candidates to showcase their problem-solving and programming knowledge skills to their interviewers.
